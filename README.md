# Photo Organiser

## About

This is an application built as a personal project using wails.io and react. It is designed to help organise photos into a folder structure based on the date the photo was taken, the folder name, and eventually location details.

## Here be dragons!

...and I'm not talking about the Wails logo!

This is by no means ready for anyone else to use because it's still in development.  And where I'd be crushed if my own photos went missing because of it, I'd really hate it if yours did, too.

However, once it's completed and ready for anyone else to use, I'll change this readme. :smile:

## Still to do

Location substitution doesn't currently work.  I have to find a service that does geolocation lookup based on lat/long, that's free and, ideally, doesn't require an API key.

It doesn't actually move/copy anything right now!  I'm in the process of making everything work how I want before actively messing with my files.

Tidy up the code.  It's a bit of a mess right now.
